3D Connect 4

This is the 3D Connect 4 made in C#, none of the GUI setting have been added to this. PHP code is not within this. This is the base function source code for the AI to work. This game was initally built with a multiplayer function - built using a client to server local network. There was also another verison prior where I used Photon to integrate online multiplayer hosted on cloud.
